# Counter-UAS Turret — Project requirements (Semester 1)

Last updated: Oct 24, 2026
The reasoning behind each choice is in `design-decisions.md`. Parts, links, prices
and order dates are in `turret_bom.xlsx`.

## Goal
Autonomous turret detects a drone, tracks it, and fires a low-power laser as a
lock-on indicator.

## Must have
- Pan-tilt motors, controlled by a **custom PCB** (a carrier board that an
  STM32 Nucleo plugs into)
- **Self-trained** neural network (not color-threshold-only): a small YOLO-nano
  class detector trained two ways (from scratch and fine-tuned from pretrained
  weights) and benchmarked against each other. Resume wording must say which one
  ships and how it was trained. Details are in "AI requirements".
- Classical CV for fast tracking between AI checks (AI about 2-5 Hz, CV about
  30 Hz or more)
- Laser activates only above a confidence threshold
- Measured: accuracy %, lock-on latency, FPS

## Won't have
- Weapon
- RF jammer
- Anything aimed at people

## Budget
- Original target: about $370 (Tier 2). **No longer binding**: a friend may help
  fund the build in exchange for a resume credit (role split still to be agreed).
- Current BOM (counted rows, incl. $80 shipping/tax/China/unknowns allowances):
  **about $530** without optional items, **about $722** with the optional
  battery set and Coral.
- Prices marked "Estimate" in the BOM (PCB fab, PCB parts, microSD, screws) will
  move as I order.

## Hardware split
- **Vision brain:** Raspberry Pi 5 **8 GB** (bought for Prototype 2, not now),
  plus a **USB camera** (Arducam 1080p autofocus) that is the same camera for
  training and the final build. Runs the neural net and decides "lock on".
  Coral accelerator is **optional and pinned** (decide at P2 after measuring the
  Pi alone).
- **Motor brain:** **STM32G474** on a **Nucleo-G474RE** that plugs into my
  custom carrier PCB. Sends step/direction pulses to two closed-loop motor
  kits, switches the laser, and the PCB handles power distribution.
- **Motors:** two **BIGTREETECH S42C V1.1** closed-loop stepper kits (motor,
  driver and encoder in one), run at **12 V** (PCB parts rated for 24 V as an
  upgrade hedge).
- **Link between brains:** serial (UART, or one USB cable into the Nucleo's
  programmer port). I2C is not used.
- **Power:** 12 V wall adapter now; a barrel jack and an XT60 footprint on the
  PCB so a battery can be added later. The PCB powers the Pi through a 5 V
  module (to be chosen about Oct 24); in Prototype 2 the Pi runs on its own wall
  supply as a safety net.
- **Laser:** cheap 5 mW 650 nm red dot module switched by a logic-level MOSFET,
  in Prototype 1 so I can see it fire on detection.

## AI requirements

**Must have**
- Two detectors, same small YOLO-nano class architecture, same data: (A) trained
  from scratch with random starting weights (not pretrained), and (B) a pretrained
  model fine-tuned on my data. Benchmark A against B on the same held-out test
  clips and ship whichever scores better. The model must run on the Raspberry Pi 5
  and train on my laptop (HP Victus, RTX GPU, Intel i5). Which exact model is still
  being researched.
- Starting data: use a public drone dataset (Kaggle) to train a first model and get
  familiar with the pipeline. Check each dataset's license and spot-check its box
  quality before using it.
- Own data: collect and label footage in the PURT hangar with the final Arducam.
  This is the test set (clips the model never trained on), and it is added to
  training later. Split by clip into train, validation and test.
- Evaluation: report precision, recall, mAP and false lock-ons on clips the model
  never saw.
- Failure analysis: find at least one failure (such as backlight), add targeted
  data, retrain, and record the before and after numbers.
- Edge deployment: export the model, run it on the Raspberry Pi 5, and measure
  latency and FPS.
- Quantization: convert to INT8 and compare accuracy and latency against the
  unquantized model.
- Hybrid loop: the detector runs at about 2-5 Hz, and an OpenCV tracker (KCF)
  runs at about 30 Hz or more between checks.
- Experiment log: record the date, dataset size, settings and metrics for every run.

**Should have**
- Data-size experiment: plot accuracy against dataset size.
- Augmentation experiment: compare accuracy with and without augmentation.
- Coral decision: measure the Pi alone first, then decide on Nov 23.

**Stretch goals**
- Classifier: train a tiny CNN from scratch on cropped detector boxes, compare it
  with a pretrained small model, and use it to confirm detections. Only if the
  detector is done by about Dec 1.
- Negative data: film birds, kites and other objects for the classifier and to cut
  false lock-ons.

**Won't have**
- A new detector architecture designed from scratch.
- A demo that depends on the classifier.

## Tools and access
- 3D printer available (pan-tilt frame and camera holder are printed)
- Purdue ECE shop for free small parts (check Monday Oct 19)

## Next semester
- Mount on drone
- Push inference toward on-chip
